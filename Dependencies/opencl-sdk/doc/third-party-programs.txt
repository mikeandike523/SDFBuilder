      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

fees (if applicable), Intel grants You a non-exclusive, worldwide,
non-assignable (except as expressly permitted hereunder), limited right and
license for the term You obtained pursuant to Section 3:

 A. under its copyrights, to:

  (1) reproduce internally a reasonable number of copies of the Materials
      for Your internal business use in accordance with the documentation or
      text files included as part of the Materials; provided, however, that this
      license does not include the right to sublicense and may only be exercised
      by You or Your employees;

  (2) use the Materials solely for Your internal business use to develop
      Your Product, in accordance with the documentation or text files included
      as part of the Materials, provided, however, that this license does not
      include the right to sublicense and may only be exercised by You or Your
      employees;

  (3) modify or create derivative works of the Materials, or any portions
      thereof, that are provided in Source Code form, provided, however, that
      this license does not include the right to sublicense and may be exercised
      only by You or Your employees;

  (4) publicly perform, publicly display, and distribute (directly and
      through Your distributors, resellers and other channel partners) or
      otherwise make publicly available the Redistributables, including any
      modifications to or derivative works of the Redistributables made pursuant
      to Section 2.1.A(3), or any portions thereof, subject to the following
      restrictions:

      (a) any distribution of the Redistributables must only be as part of
          Your Product which must add significantly more functionality than the
          Redistributables themselves;
    
      (b) any additional restrictions which may appear in the
          Redistributables text files specified in Section 1.G above and in
          Section 4 below; and
     
      (c) the license under Section 2.1.A(4) includes the right to
          sublicense the Redistributables, but the sublicense rights are limited
          only to the sublicensing of any Intel copyrights in the
          Redistributables and only to the extent necessary to perform, display,
          and distribute the Redistributables (including Your modifications and
          derivative works thereto) solely as incorporated in Your Product.
    
      (d) You (i) will be solely responsible to Your customers for any
          update, support obligation or other liability which may arise from
          Your distribution of Your Product, (ii) will not make any statement
          that Your Product is "certified" or that its performance is guaranteed
          by Intel, (iii) will not use Intel's name or trademarks to market Your
          Product without written permission from Intel, (iv) will provide the
          Redistributables subject to a license agreement that prohibits
          disassembly and reverse engineering of the Redistributables except in
          cases where You provide Your Product subject to an open source license
          that is not an Excluded License, (e.g., the BSD license or the MIT
          license), (v) will indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Intel and its
          suppliers from and against any claims or lawsuits, including
          attorney's fees, that arise or result from Your modifications,
          derivative works or Your distribution of Your Product.

    and

 B. under Intel's Licensed Patent Claims, to:

  (1) make copies of the Materials only as specified in Section 2.1.A(1);

  (2) use the Materials only as specified in Section 2.1.A(2); and

  (3) offer to distribute, and distribute, but not sell, the Redistributables
      only as part of Your Product, under Intel's copyright license granted in
      Section 2.1(A), but only under the terms of that copyright license and not
      as a sale (but this right does not include the right to sub-license);

    And, provided further, that the license under the Licensed Patent Claims
    does not and will not apply to, and Intel does not expressly grant You a
    patent license in this Agreement to, any modifications to, or derivative
    works of, the Materials, whether made by You, Your contractor, Your customer
    (which, for all purposes under this Agreement, will mean either a customer,
    reseller, distributor or other channel partner), or any third party even if
    the modification and derivative works are permitted under 2.1.A(3).

2.2 License for Noncommercial License Types. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, including the applicable license type use restrictions in
Section 3.2 and other restrictions in Section 4 below, and timely payment of any
fees (if applicable), Intel grants You a non-exclusive, worldwide,
non-assignable, limited right and license for the term You obtained pursuant to
Section 3, and under its copyrights, to:

 A. reproduce a reasonable number of copies of the Materials internally and
    use the Materials solely for Your internal evaluation, business or personal
    use in accordance with the documentation or text files included as part of
    the Materials, and for no commercial uses whatsoever; provided, however,
    that this license does not include the right to sublicense and may only be
    exercised by You or Your employees (if any);

 B. modify or create derivative works of the Materials, or any portions
    thereof, that are provided in Source Code form, provided, however, that this
    license does not include a right to redistribute the modifications or
    derivative works of the Materials, or the right to sublicense and may be
    exercised only by You or Your employees (if any);

 C. except for an evaluation license type, publicly perform, publicly
    display, and distribute or otherwise make publicly available the
    Redistributables, including any modifications to or derivative works of the
    Redistributables made pursuant to Section 2.2.B, or any portions thereof
    only for noncommercial uses, subject to the following restrictions:

  (1) any distribution of the Redistributables must only be as part of Your
      Project which must add significantly more functionality than the
      Redistributables themselves;

  (2) any additional restrictions which may appear in the Redistributables
      text files specified in Section 1.G above and in Section 4 below; and
 
  (3) the license under Section 2.2.C includes the right to sublicense the
      Redistributables, but the sublicense rights are limited only to the
      sublicensing of any Intel copyrights in the Redistributables and only to
      the extent necessary to perform, display, and distribute the
      Redistributables (including Your modifications and derivative works
      thereto) solely as incorporated in Your Project.

  (4) You (i) will be solely responsible for any update, support obligation
      or other liability which may arise from Your distribution of Your Project,
      (ii) will not make any statement that Your Project is "certified" or that
      its performance is guaranteed by Intel, (iii) will not use Intel's name or
      trademarks in connection with Your Project without written permission from
      Intel, (iv) will provide the Redistributables subject to a license
      agreement that prohibits disassembly and reverse engineering of the
      Redistributables except in cases where You provide Your Project subject to
      an open source license that is not an Excluded License (e.g., the BSD
      license or the MIT license), (v) will indemnify, hold harmless, and defend
      Intel and its suppliers from and against any claims or lawsuits, including
      attorney's fees, that arise or result from Your modifications, derivative
      works or Your distribution of Your Project.

2.3 Third Party Programs and Other Intel Programs Licenses. Third Party
Programs, even if included with the distribution of the Materials, are governed
by separate license terms, including without limitation, third party license
terms, other Intel software license terms, and open source software license
terms. Such separate license terms (and not this Agreement) solely govern Your
use of the Third Party Programs.

3. LICENSE USE TYPES.

3.1 Commercial License Types. Commercial license types are provided under the
terms of the license set forth in Section 2.1.

 A. Single Named-User License. If You obtain the Materials under a single
    named-user license type, You may install the Materials on no more than three
    (3) computers for use by a single user, provided that same user is using the

      as of the date such litigation is filed.

    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
