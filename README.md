*Generate Signed Distance Fields with STL files*



### Features

- Import STL files with a simple drag-and drop.
- Visualize STL files with eye-pleasing smooth shading
- Generate signed distance fields, and export [Paule Bourke](http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/volumetric/#:~:text=Volume%20data%20format&text=A%20bit%20like%20the%20PPM,as%20having%20more%20header%20fields.) volumetric data
